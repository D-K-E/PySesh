# PySesh
A Python OCR Complement to Jsesh
--------
This project is a reimplementation of Michele Moglia's project on lunchpad, see: https://launchpad.net/pysesh
    
  Our goal with this project is to implement slowly some of the functions of Jsesh for mass treatement of encoded egyptian texts.  The milestones are currently being discussed with M. Serge Rosmorduc, the developper of Jsesh. 
  
  For OCR side the following goals are being established:
  
  * 1. Our input would be a scanned page and our output would be MDC file.
  * 2. Implement a Generative Adverserial Network for separating sections that contain 
      hieroglyphic characters in books
  * 3. Implement a line separating algorithm for separating lines/columns in hieroglyphic texts
  * 4. Implement character/sequence recognizer
